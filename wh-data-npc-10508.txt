I died once to them. Anyway, mage killed the two in group that he could and then ran from room with the two others following that are immune to spell damage. Warlock jumped down (need to jump down from corridor above room in order to avoid aggro), opened door and ran in. As soon as the mage makes it out of instance the two mobs on him will run back and attack the warlock. The warlock must die! Wait for mobs to leave, then soulstone rez. Mage runs back down to room, but this time uses invisibility to get past the skeletons immune to spell damage. \nRaz is a tough fight, but if you have good DPS then you can do him. He has 33k health and puts out a bit of damage. Health stones and pots will guarantee your win.\nGL :)","date":"2007-08-18T15:10:30-05:00","rating":4,"indent":0,"roles":64,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"beta":false},"imported":true,"importedAuthor":"MrMagePower","importedSubject":"Re: Ras Frostwhisper"},{"commentv2":1,"number":22,"id":2799934,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Thottbot","body":"Actually you can farm her in 15-18 min as 70 resto shaman(would be faster if i would not be resto).

Kill the 4 mobs there near the door.. leave the rest of the room alone. Open the door. Run through the neutral room, stealth to the back of Ras's room without aggroing.  Attack him right here in the back in kitty. I did have to pop out and heal\/health pot mid-fight, but it was my first attempt. I'm sure either some frost resist or well timed heals would fix that. Don't let yourself get too low as he will ice trap you and hit on you at some point. Loot. \n\nGo naked, walk to the other mobs to let them kill you.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I am farming this boss to try and get the Flask of Supreme power recipe. The fastest way to get to him is like this:<br /><b>You should be level 70. You must be a Warlock! And have an Invisibilty potion.</b><br /><br />Enter the Scholomance instance, get out your voidwalker, and put a soulstone on yourself.&nbsp; Jump down into the room with the door that requires the Viewing room key, and&nbsp; then use sacrifice. You will agro all the mobs so you must be quick. Run to the other gate/door which leads into the side room, and die away from a group of mobs. Wait for the other mobs to leave, and then ress. <b>Use you Invisibilty potion straight away!</b> Now run as fast as you can past all those dragon whelps and you should become visible on the stair case just after the room. Go down, get out your Voidwalker and start killing the Risen construct's, the best way it to place on Curse of Agony, and Corruption, then just heal you voidwalker with the Health channel. You <b>do not</b> need to clear the entire room, so pull &quot;Rattlegore&quot; when it is sensible, same strategy for him, try not to get agro, grab the viewing room key.<br />Now you must die, so take off all your clothes to save on your repair bill. Once you dead run back into the instance with the key. Jump down again into 1 group of mobs, clear the room and continue to Ras Frostwhisper! I managed to do that all in under 30 minutes. So it saves some time. And once your done, you soulstone will be reset for you to try again. <br />Obviously if you die accidently when killing Rattlegore, you have failed and must wait for you Soulstone cooldown :(<br /><br />I know this is not at all useful to anyone except a Warlock, but thought I would mention this anyway! Hope it helps.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Level 70 arcane/fire mage and level 60 destruction warlock took him down. Killed our way to Raztaz (forget his name), got the viewing key from him, made our way back to room with door for viewing key. Got owned... once, twice, thrice, before we figured out how to do it. Warlock soulstones. Mage kills group in corner closest to door. Take note there are two skeletons that are immune to spell damage. They are not elite, but they will kill a clothie without any effort! I died once to them. Anyway, mage killed the two in group that he could and then ran from room with the two others following that are immune to spell damage. Warlock jumped down (need to jump down from corridor above room in order to avoid aggro), opened door and ran in. As soon as the mage makes it out of instance the two mobs on him will run back and attack the warlock. The warlock must die! Wait for mobs to leave, then soulstone rez. Mage runs back down to room, but this time uses invisibility to get past the skeletons immune to spell damage. <br />Raz is a tough fight, but if you have good DPS then you can do him. He has 33k health and puts out a bit of damage. Health stones and pots will guarantee your win.<br />GL :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Actually you can farm her in 15-18 min as 70 resto shaman(would be faster if i would not be resto). You go in jump down to the left. Make sure you jump on the wall. no aggro. Sneak in to the other room and go through the mobs. Go to the room of the dragons. Kill the group to the left. (optional. if you can sneak good it is not necessary) Jump down on the first hole. Make sure you hit the top left corner. Sneak behind the boss. Pull the mob, right side of the boss' back to the wall. (optional as you can pull the boss when the 2 guard is furthest from him) Make sure you pull it when he is far from the boss. Kill it and than kill boss (watch the movement of the mob left to the boss. If too close to the boss will aggro). Than you can basically run back to room where the door is without a single fight. Go through the mobs and go into the Right top corner of the room (where the door is). Kill that group and than open the door and kill Ras. Should not take more than 18 min as a shaman and i am resto:). IMPORTANT: watch your totems. Put them down before except the fire totem and pull them off when mob is at 1% so you dont aggro other mobs. Well geared warrior, for sure pala should be able to do the same.&nbsp; I use Adept's elixir only. Could do it without ittoo. When you killed Rus you can sneak through the mobs till the 2 guard. otherwise just run and earthbind and Stoneclaw totem them.</div>

I opened with an Avenger's Shield, and just as I was going through my aggro-maintaining ritual, I got freeze-trapped.<br /><br />I was so astonished that by the time I thought to bubble myself to dispel it, the others 70s in the group had killed Ras.<br /><br />I giggled for the remainder of the Dreadsteed quest over that.

After killing this mob, wait for the one next to Razor to pat away and then pull. I had to keep Lifebloom up a lot for Razor. Don't fight him in his room, for the knowback could send you into other mobs<br /><br />You also do not need to kill the 4 mobs in front of the Viewing Room Door. You can stealth up around the wall on the small ledge on the floor and move around to the door. Stay against the wall and you can reach the door and unlock it without aggro.<br /><br />Ras was easy as resto. 3 attempts and no recipe. I think I will just grind out the last 5000 rep for Keepers to Exalted :)<br /><br />I stayed in NE form the whole time. No need for Bear, but this all might depend on your talent spec and + heal.<br /><br />Outis (Cenarius)<br /><br /><i>Edited, Apr 10th 2008 3:20pm by Hupostasis</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I soloed the scholo key chain and Ras last night on my 70 feral druid. Motivation is to try and get the Flask of Supreme Power in my solo time. (I'm happy to grind KoT rep, but there are few runs happening after my guild's raid times) My very first run took about 13 minutes to kill Razorgore and Ras, and that included one death on Razorgore from a bad pull. I think I can get it down under 10 minutes. Sadly, i'm herb/alch. I think i'll bring a tag-along enchanter next time -- 3 large brills in &lt; 10m is nice. <br /><br />This should be self-explanatory, but here it is anyhow:<br /><br />Stealth up, jump the right railing. Turn around left and go through the gate. Head to Razorgore. Pull 3-4 of the adds in front of him in bear gear/form. Pull Razorgore, be sure to get him alone. I didn't have any trouble killing him in bear. (he'll shred you in kitty form) Loot the key<br /><br />Kitty stealth back upstairs right to the viewing room door (right where you landed when you jumped the railing). Kill the 4 mobs there near the door.. leave the rest of the room alone. Open the door. Run through the neutral room, stealth to the back of Ras's room without aggroing. Attack him right here in the back in kitty. I did have to pop out and heal/health pot mid-fight, but it was my first attempt. I'm sure either some frost resist or well timed heals would fix that. Don't let yourself get too low as he will ice trap you and hit on you at some point. Loot. <br /><br />Go naked, walk to the other mobs to let them kill you. Run into the instance, run out, reset the instance, lather, rinse, repeat. <br /><br />On my server large brills go for 6-7g. 3 per run is 20g per 10m, so a feral enchanter should be able to get about 120g per hour doing this farm, not counting any possible phat drops.</div>
