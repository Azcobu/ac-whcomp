I'd highly suggest you start your character on a new server if you are an Alliance playing on a PvP, RP, or RPPvP server.\n\nAnywho, choose a male tauren in the character creation screen. You can choose any class you like for him, but I personally went with Warrior. :)\n\nNow, change the tauren's looks so that he has the following:\n\nSkin Color - Dark gray blending into white\nFace - The one with the red eyes\nHorn Style - Short, curved\nHorn Color - White\nFacial Hair - None\nyou can see the example here:\nhttp:\/\/img95.imageshack.us\/img95\/5638\/wowscrnshot011507004748je9.jpg\n\nNow name your character Gamon (duh) and create! If the name is unavailable, copy and paste one of the following O's and replace the O in the name: � � �\n\nNow the hard part. Level your character to level 42 or higher.

You have to perform a sort of mini-death quest to get in the proper ghost form, which is as follows:\n\nAfter killing Gamon 35 times, jump from the zeppelin that moves from Durotar to Tirisfal into the Great Sea. Once there, a rare spawn known as Krakonia will attack you immediately. She's level 15, and fairly weak to be honest, I took her out with my level 10 shaman easy. The cool thing is that her loot is also superhot. She dropped 2 blues for me. More importantly, she drops the Ring of the Water Wraith. Put this ring on and drown. When you die, you can ressurect as a Water Wraith, a special kind of ghost.\n\nWhen in this ghost form, make your way to where you would normally find Gamon...and there will be Gamon's Avatar! Talk to him to begin an epic questline that will span nearly 50 levels.

He killed my pet but I was able to wing clip and kite him for a few seconds to down him before he killed me. A 70 BM hunter might be able to take Gamon down alone, same with maybe a demon lock, but I wouldn't want to solo him without a pet class.<br /><br />Grab a friend from the bank or AH to help you, Gamon hits like a truck.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>moonasha</b></h3>One of these days someone is going to hit Gamon and he's going to go completely insane. He'll hit the barkeep for 70k damage, bite the inkeepers head off and then wipe his arse with the nearby afk level 30.<br /><br />Roaring, he'll smash his way through the wall (kool-aid man style) then take out the Auction House.</div>

Best part is, we don't get any xp from him. <br /><br />when I'm on other toons, I can't resist much either. Best thing I do is on my warlock, curse of weakness and chain fear.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I have heard that Gamon is going to be a MC boss in patch 1.12. Hes going to be harder then Ragranos...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>First of all, you need to bring s (And Mana Potions if possible)<br /><br />1. The Perfect Team<br />You need atleast 5 people to take him down.<br />1 Tank<br />1 Priest<br />1 Shaman/Paladin<br />1 Mage/Warlock<br />1 rogue<br /><br />2. Get in Combat!<br />The Tank starts charging. This is very tricky, since Gamon is placed behind a wall. After the tank get him&nbsp; out, the priest and shaman/paladin imidatly start healing. Inbetween the Rogue has stealthed behind Gamon and the Warrior is using Sunder Armor. The Mage&nbsp; needs to be ready to polymorph adds (Wich rarely happends). The mage is also needed to slow him down, in the case that the Maintank dies.<br /><br />3. Gamon Dead<br />After the 20 minutes long fight, you need your rewards. Around 5 copper each and you need to Roll&nbsp; on it. In case that epics drops, you might need to put out Master Loot on. (Seen People ninja him)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I killed Gamon once, then about 5 minutes later went back there and saw his body here with Gamon standing ON him... i killed that one and there were two Gamon Bodies, Obviously Gamon must be making Clones</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>With the help of a few &quot;sources&quot;, I've managed to learn how to dress up as Gamon, the killable level 12 Tauren NPC in Orgrimmar. And you can dress up as him, too! Simply follow these (mostly) simple instructions.<br /><br />1. Creation &amp; Looks<br /><br />Okay, for starters, you need to make a new character. I'd highly suggest you start your character on a new server if you are an Alliance playing on a PvP, RP, or RPPvP server.<br /><br />Anywho, choose a male tauren in the character creation screen. You can choose any class you like for him, but I personally went with Warrior. :)<br /><br />Now, change the tauren's looks so that he has the following:<br /><br />Skin Color - Dark gray blending into white<br />Face - The one with the red eyes<br />Horn Style - Short, curved<br />Horn Color - White<br />Facial Hair - None<br />you can see the example here:<br /><a href="http://img95.imageshack.us/img95/5638/wowscrnshot011507004748je9.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img95.imageshack.us/img95/5638/wowscrnshot011507004748je9.jpg</a><br /><br />Now name your character Gamon (duh) and create! If the name is unavailable, copy and paste one of the following O's and replace the O in the name: � � �<br /><br />Now the hard part. Level your character to level 42 or higher. Next, aquire the following items:<br /><br /><a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/item=39529">https://tbc.wowhead.com/item=39529</a><br /><a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/item=10097">https://tbc.wowhead.com/item=10097</a><br /><a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/item=13053">https://tbc.wowhead.com/item=13053</a><br /><a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/item=12237">https://tbc.wowhead.com/item=12237</a><br /><a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/item=5510">https://tbc.wowhead.com/item=5510</a><br /><br />Now, take all your weapons and armor off and equip the ones mentioned above (once you've aquired them all). Congrats, you're now dressed up as Gamon! For added effect, go to the inn in Orgrimmar, stand next to the brazier, and type /kneel.<br /><br />And there ya go. :D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Poor Gamon...<br />He�s killed more than 1000 times every day...<br /><br />Peace be with him<br /><br />(rofl)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ok, the ultimate rogue guid to kill the evil Tauren Gamon.<br /><br /><b>Make sure you're well geared, preferably Skinning Knife in your main hand enchanted with Crusader - You will need it.</b><br /><br />Then, the moment has arrived. Get in stealth (You should respec your talent tree to subtlety as he has the buff <a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?s=Paranoia">Paranoia</a>). Make sure your <a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?s=Skinning%20Knife">Skinning Knife</a> is sharpened and ambush him! Make sure you get Cripling poison on him as he will wander and draw adds. Then, try to<br />stunlock him, gouge him, kidney-shot him!<br /><br />If all goes well, you already lost half of your HP, and Gamon is still at 83%. Ask a priest to come and heal you and finish the job with stunlock and some plain backstabs.<br /><br />Good job! You killed Gamon, a level 12 tauren! If you get in lucky, you'll get 93 copper of him, which you have to share with your priest. Oh yeah, some linen cloth which you really need to bandage all of those deep wounds.<br /><br />Finally, skin the guy - Gamon's Hide is an epic drop, goes for 100-250G @ AH.<br /><br />Regards, DennieX</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Gamon is F***** hard, holy $%^&amp;.<br /><br />He has about 1, 000,000 hp and 50 000 defense hes so damn hard that we had team up with 40 ppl and then we could only take him halfway. So my guild got every1 from my server to take him down and about 20-30% of the population died. Even still then we cant take him down.. What the $%^&amp;? so i contacted a GM and cried like a %^&amp;*! saying &quot;gamon is so mother f'in hard!&quot; so they replied fine We gm's will help you kill this npc. sO we wait for half an hour standing away from Gamon, like totally away. like all the way to the Hall of Legends. Very scary.&nbsp; so the GM came and faced gamon 1v1, gamon is just sitting there laughing at us calling us names. So the GM was like let's end this madness... so he attacked Gamon.<br /><br />All of a sudden I wake up.<br /><br />*!@#, it's a dream...</div>

He then started a massacre of everything in that realm. many people chose to take their lives rather than face his wrath, although he was fast enough to kill many people before they had time to. blizzard tried to shut down the realm to stop him from entering the real world and destroying the earth. but he was too fast. he escaped the computer but chuck norris sensed the danger and quickly tore his face off and stabbed him to death with his one of his own rib bones before he could do any more damage. whats really sad, tho, is that now blizz have removed most of his power even a single party of lvl 70s can kill him. hes gaining his strength, so watch yourselves out there, kiddies :D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Took him on with 10 70's. We had two hunters, two preists, a rogue, shammy, warrior, two warlocks and a druid. We had warrior aggro and basically kited him all the way back to thrall's chamber, letting his AoE damage pull a few guards along the way. We got him to 40% and then a healer got aggro when MDs didnt go off fast enough. He took out the preists then troll boss and then we went down one by one. Granted he's a hard boss to take, drops some awesome loot and we're only geared up to the Eye group-wise. Grats to everyone who could take him.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>found Gamon in the inn inside Orgrimmar. Picked his pocket and got Tazan's key, then used that to open Tazan's Satchel, giving me Tazan's Logbook.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I didn't even know there was a reason to kill him. He looked different, his name was in gold so I right clicked, killed him quick with my lvl 12 hunter and pet raptor. Plus a couple BEs that came out of no where threw in a couple shots. Surprised me, I had no idea he'd attack. Lol.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>if you guys arent kidding about not soloing him then your crazy, cause as a lvl 60 rogue i can 1 shot him with ambush with not very good gear, and without me killing him instantly he does no special things against me and hits for like 5.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>My guild downed him today on Arthas Server. Very tough fight. Don't let the other posts fool you. YOU CANNOT SOLO THIS GUY. Had 40man raid and 5 priests. We wiped twice before succeeding. Dropped some PHAT LEWT. Linen cloth and haunch of meat. And also dropped an epic <br /><a href="/item=14115">Aboriginal Bands</a> <br />Got out rolled though /cry.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Just to be clear - we ARE talking about the level 12 Tauren that I just killed in the Orgrimmar tavern with my level 31 Hunter, with no trouble at all?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>I kill him easily as a 41 lock and even lower.<br />However this guy intrigues me with his Gamon Avatar story and it may be a real hidden quest... however I checked for Krakonia and Ring of Water Wraith are NOT listed here on this site. So... I need some proof that it is not a hoax...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>WTF ppl?<br />I checked if there is a quest that gamon is involved in and all I find is a bunch of tards talking &amp;*!@ !<br />you really need to fing sth to do!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Little known fact: Gamon is actually second cousin to the cow king of secret level fame, thus making him a duke. Just see what happens if you use Wirt's Third Leg on him!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Ok, from the previous post the cow king is from Diablo 2, a strong lightning resistant boss, in the secret cow level. To open the portal you need to get Wirt's Leg from Tristram and can only open the portal if you have defeated Baal (last diablo 2 boss). Im not sure what happens when you attack with Wirt's THIRD Leg but it seems awfully suspicious that something may happen, but relation i have no idea maybe coriolos is telling LIES. I know this as a fact because i play WoW and Diablo 2. Maybe ill buy Wirt's Third leg then ill tell you guys if anything happens.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>why would you want to kill him?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Actually, Gamon is probably one of the most important characters in the game. Mainly because you can farm the most ridiculously overpowered loot in the game from him, but also because of the Forwig Suzzle questline.<br /><br />Little known fact, you can start this quest line at level 3 or so and end it before level 10.<br /><br />So the first thing you need to do is kill Gamon 35 times...I understand that the wait between spawns is a pain, and you'll be in competition with tons of other folks trying to get to his unbelievably sweet loot, but it's quite worth it.<br /><br />After 35 kills, you'll be able to access Gamon's Avatar, a special mob that only appears to you when you're in ghost form...very similar to the MC attunement quest, etc. The trick is this: you can't JUST be in ghost form. You have to perform a sort of mini-death quest to get in the proper ghost form, which is as follows:<br /><br />After killing Gamon 35 times, jump from the zeppelin that moves from Durotar to Tirisfal into the Great Sea. Once there, a rare spawn known as Krakonia will attack you immediately. She's level 15, and fairly weak to be honest, I took her out with my level 10 shaman easy. The cool thing is that her loot is also superhot. She dropped 2 blues for me. More importantly, she drops the Ring of the Water Wraith. Put this ring on and drown. When you die, you can ressurect as a Water Wraith, a special kind of ghost.<br /><br />When in this ghost form, make your way to where you would normally find Gamon...and there will be Gamon's Avatar! Talk to him to begin an epic questline that will span nearly 50 levels. Easy xp, great loot, all and all well worth the trouble.<br /><br />;-)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>Hurrah, I finally understand now why half of teh times I land in the flight tower in Ogrimmar the first combat log message is &quot;Gamon dies&quot; :) I thought it was some kind of obscure bug...<br /><br />Now I need to get my 40man raid to do it myself ;)</div>
