I hate this guy :)<br /><br />Once u complete the quest chain for thsi guy, you can get the blood by killing the succubus in room 1 (where you get darrowshire deed/library kinda room)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Komplex0r</b></h3>Be careful not to tank him at the window. He kicked me out of the instance</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Lordship</b></h3>He is rather hard to solo as a rogue as he has a long disarm which he uses too often for my tastes. Only chance you have then is to shiv him and use the points on SnD or wait until you get your weapon back to do a full eviscerate.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>138709</b></h3>Solo'd. 70 SL/SL Lock</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>nepidae</b></h3>From a lore perspective there is a &quot;Kirtonos Bros. Funeral Home&quot; in Stratholme, kinda cool.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>IAmColumbo</b></h3>I cant solo him as a 70 rogue in full epics.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Yes, you currently cannot kill him again unless you have the blood from the quest. However, as noted on the wow website, the next patch will cause the butcher to drop blood everytime (which they delayed releasing until next Tuesday because of today's hardware upgrade maintenance).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>just guessing at the moment but i bet u could summon him as many times as u like if u stay in a raid party, seeing as u can't complete quests in a raidparty</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Has anyone tried the raid trick to keep summoning?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>You can only fight him once per raid as the brazier stays lit and you cant relight it. He isnt very deep into the dungeon though, its actually quite easy to get to him, you could probably even do it with a 5 person group. Just get some friends with the blood and have them help you kill him, then reset the instance and fight to him again.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Just a tip, do -not- fight him against the &quot;opening&quot; in lack of a better word. The one he comes in through.<br /><br />He needs to face the room and not the opening, as he can throw you out of the instance that way! <br /><br />He did it to me.... Leaving the 4 that were left in there to fend for themselves. <br />Didn't go too well...<br /><br />We'll try again tomorrow. Was kind of late when we tried him now..<br /><br />And btw, damn I hate these quests... So $%^&amp;ing boring.<br /><br />/Binabik</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>where do you get the quest/blood from</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I'm about to try dropping the quest after he dies so I can get blood again from Eva and farm Kirtonos. Anyone know if it will work?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Since the 1.6 patch there's a new spawn in the first scholo room called Blood Steward of Kirtonos (looks like a succubus). She should drop the blood so you can summon Kirtonos if you don't have the blood from the questline.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Just need to know where you get the Quest for the Blood, dont need lectures on how to form groups.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Make sure he is facing stairs</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Firstly.. two warrs don't equal death.&nbsp; You don't need a mage.&nbsp; You can 5 man scholo with all sorts of groups if you have smart ppl.<br /><br />The only things you REALLY need is a good MT and a Priest.<br /><br />Rogue can sap<br />Lock can seduce/ae/silence<br />Priest can silence/shackle<br /><br />2nd Warr can DPS<br />Hunter can DPS<br />2nd Shadow priest can shackle/silence/DPS <br /><br />In fact, a 2nd shadow priest is Massively valuable in Scholo because you many times have TWO elites to deal with.. double shackle.. done.&nbsp; Encounters are now cake.&nbsp; That's not even counting the double silence for summoners.<br /><br />2nd warrior is very useful if the MT loses aggro due to the knockback attacks of MANY of the scholo bosses, ravenian, Raz, Kirtonos, etc.<br /><br />At any rate.. to kill Kirtonos, just fight up on the stairs with your back to the wall.. let the MT get 10-15 seconds of aggro them DPS him.&nbsp; Flash heals are sufficient.&nbsp; He's ez if MT keeps aggro.&nbsp; <br /><br />He WILL MC someone from time to time, it wears off after about 10-15 seconds or so, just heal the guy being attacked, don't bother attacking the MCed dude.&nbsp; Or sheep him or silence him whatnot.<br /><br />Just make sure you don't get knocked back out the window or off the stairs, that will cause you your only real problems.<br /><br />GL with the VALOR drops!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>First time we tried to take him on, 2 people were still out of the brazier's room, and the door actually closes when the boss comes in.<br />That left only 3 to deal with him which is clearly not enough :)<br />As people said, he also knocks you back, so don't get between him and the window.<br /><br />Apart of that, he is very doable in 5 man, like the rest of the instance of course.<br /><br />For me he's like 3rd hardest boss in the instance, lord alexei being the first by far and maybe rattlegore the 2nd (the rest are not really bosses, merely boosted elites). All this from a 5man point of view (never did this instance in raid)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>those who say you gotta have this and this to do a 5 man run are weak.<br /><br />did it last night with 2 druids... BOTH resto spec'd... a arms/fury MS warrior... a paladin, and a mage... and we spanked this place like it was our job! <br /><br />btw...&nbsp; you dont need a priest everywhere... you dont need a mage everywhere...&nbsp; really you don't need a warrior everywhere...&nbsp; or any class in particular.<br /><br />actually, I'm a big fan of running instances with 2-3 hunters too.&nbsp; silly bastages!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Anyone know what this guys attack speed actually is in bat form?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Warrior's are MT no doubt about that. But paladin can handle aggro if they know what they are doing.<br /><br />FYI, we did Rattlegore 4-man with me as MT and no one died(we were tired of waiting for the tank being afk).<br /><br />Anyway, as long as someone is able to hold aggro and you have a 1-2 good dps, Kir is an easy fight.<br /><br />Gratzs to any warrior who wins the boots!<br /><br />Corb<br />lvl 60 paladin Dalaran server</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Ran it as a stealth run with one druid and three rogues;&nbsp; druid was 58 (but has mad skills).&nbsp; Piece of cake :o)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>I was the rogue in the group and it wasn't pretty after he MC'd me and then used cold blood, eviscerate, perparation, cold blood and&nbsp; eviscerate again on our priest. &gt;.&lt;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i where in a group, 6-10 cant remember when we begun, but i didn't find this guy hard, we just attacked, battled, and after some time, he was dead, i didn't see anyone especialy damaged</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Gday. Was fighting kirtonos for the bazillionth time today and she fled.. anybody had this happen before? couldnt find her anywhere on the level. is there a timer?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>i havent been at scholo in a while...<br />i really hate it :)<br />and i was wondering, where is this guy? is he one of the bosses u need to kill befor u can get main intense boss?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Question:<br />Can Kirtonos be summoned and killed twice in one instance? I haven't tried this yet but, if you enter the instance with Blood....then kill Kirtonos....then kill Blood Steward....can you go back and summon Kirtonos again?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Like all bosses, he doesn't respawn until you reset the instance. The problem is that if you screw it up the first time, he despawns anyways so make sure everyone is ready. <br /><br />ANOTHER important note is that if the ML gets kicked through the window but you kill him anyways, the loot is considered as group loot and the ML doesn't get to roll =S</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Just to confirm, when you pick up the third quest in the series (the one after you kill Jandice), you get the blood of innocents to summon him.<br /><br />If he doesn't drop what you want, instead of trying for a drop of the blood of innocents somewhere else in the instance, you can simply abandon the quest and pick it up again.&nbsp; When you do this you get another blood of innocents, so you can summon him again.<br /><br />You can do this multiple times to try to get the warrior boots (he drops the boots of valor/tier 0.5), and/or to work on other drops.&nbsp; He is so close to the instance entrance it doesn't take very long to get to him at all.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>He seems to have four abilites:<br /><br />Swoop: ~2 second stun, small AOE (melee damage +x)<br />Wing Flap: The feared knockback attack.<br />Pierce Armor: -50% armor debuff, 20 second duration.<br />Disarm: Regular disarm, 10 second duration.<br /><br />Been farming him duo (warrior + shaman, medium gear), and he has never used mind control, so I assume it has been removed. His damage is around 1100-1300 unmodified.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Lvl 70 warlock, demon spec. Able to dot, dot, dot.. health funnel on the felguard.. soul shatter and bring kirtonos down. Killed him multiple times, farming scholo for shards. Scholo has become the new Scarlet Monastery for well equipped players.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thottbot</b></h3>Blood steward doesn't drop blood of the innocent.&nbsp; If you fail you have to abandon quest, talk to Eva again, and reset the instance before trying again.&nbsp; Not sure if 2.3 patch or something changed that.<br />Having a hard time soloing it with my 69 hunter due to mind control.&nbsp; Not sure if I could quickly disarm myself when I see that coming or something.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>This guy is easy to beat, coz me (a 59 feral druid) and a 63 warrior managed to get him down to 2k health, with me healing. I didnt even have 2 use a rez. And we only wiped coz he mind controlled me, put me in cat form (i still had full health) and killed the warrior. The boss then dissapeared, and when i regained control, he was gone and i couldnt fight him &gt;&lt; so it should be extremely easy for a 5-man group or if the warrior had some sort of potions or buffs.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allakhazam</b></h3>He dropped the Jeweled Amulet of Cainwyn once, which I now wear.</div>
