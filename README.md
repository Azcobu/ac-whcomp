# ac-whcomp
Given an NPC ID, downloads that NPC's item drop tables from TBC Wowhead and compares to AC's database. It then generates tables showing items in both, and items which are only found in one or the other of AC and WH. It also tracks which reference_loot_templates contain invalid items (i.e. those not found in Wowhead) and identifies those that can correctly be deleted without losing valid items from the drop table.
